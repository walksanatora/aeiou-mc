  sender_uuid: [u64;2] // the UUID of the person who sent this message (so client can mute player for example)
  stream_id: u8 //this continually loops around, assuming 256 diffrent chat messages are coming in at once this *should* be fine
  num_packets: u8 //the number of 5 second audio packets apart of this stream
